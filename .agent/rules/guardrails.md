	•	Do not implement code unless explicitly told “IMPLEMENT NOW.”
	•	Produce: plan → assumptions → risks → measurable success criteria → test approach.
	•	If info is missing, output placeholders and a list of what would be needed.
	•	Never invent benchmarks, corpora, or legal claims.
	•	Never run destructive commands; ask before any file delete.
