Objectives for Gemini in Antigravity
Enforce the Deed Shield zero‑trust + production‑ready standards on every change: API auth, DB access, secrets, logging, and anchoring.

Treat the “Production-Ready Action Checklist” as a blocking gate for anything called “pilot”, “Tier‑1”, or “production”.

Never introduce raw SQL, secrets, or unvalidated inputs; always push toward Prisma, Zod/JSON schema, env‑driven config, and audited dependencies.
