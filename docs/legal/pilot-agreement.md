## 2. Beta Status Acknowledgement
You acknowledge that:
- The Service is in a **pre-production, beta state**.
- The Service operates as a **Simulator**, not a live recording system.
- Data may be erased or reset without notice during the Pilot.

## 3. License to Use
We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access the Simulator for internal testing and evaluation purposes only.

## 4. Restrictions
You shall not:
- Reverse engineer the core verification logic.
- Use the Pilot output to misrepresent the legal status of any real-world property.
- Upload real person's data (PII) without prior written consent and appropriate data processing agreements.

## 5. Feedback
You agree that any feedback, suggestions, or bug reports you provide may be used by us to improve the product without any obligation or compensation to you.

## 6. Term and Termination
- **Term:** This Agreement remains in effect until the Pilot Phase concludes or is terminated by either party.
- **Termination:** We may terminate your access to the Pilot at any time, for any reason.

## 7. No Indemnity
Because this is a free or low-cost Pilot, Deed Shield will **NOT** indemnify you against third-party claims arising from your use of the Service.
