## 1. Introduction and Acceptance
These Master Service Terms ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Deed Shield property record verification platform, including our API, web portal, and simulator tools (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

## 2. Nature of Service: Pilot and Beta Disclaimer
**acknowledge and agree that:**
1.  **Beta Status:** The Service is currently in a "Pilot" or "Beta" phase. It may contain bugs, errors, or incompleteness.
2.  **Simulator Only:** The Service acts as a **technical verification simulator** utilizing synthetic data. It is **NOT** connected to live government recording systems.
3.  **No Legal Determinations:** The Service provides cryptographic verification of data integrity and notary registry status. It **DOES NOT** provide legal opinions, title abstracts, or guarantees of a document's validity, enforceability, or effectiveness. "PASS" results indicate technical alignment, not legal soundness.

## 3. User Obligations
You agree to:
- Use the Service only for lawful purposes in accordance with these Terms.
- **Prohibition on Real PII:** Strictly avoid uploading real, non-redacted Personally Identifiable Information (PII) during the Pilot Phase unless explicitly authorized in writing.
- Maintain the confidentiality of your API keys and credentials.

## 4. Intellectual Property
Deed Shield retains all rights, title, and interest in the Service, including its verification algorithms, anchoring logic, and documentation. You imply no transfer of ownership.

## 5. Warranties and Disclaimers
**THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.**
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DEED SHIELD DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE.

## 6. Limitation of Liability
**TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:**
1.  **Indirect Damages:** Deed Shield shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including loss of profits, data, or business opportunities.
2.  **Liability Cap:** Our total cumulative liability arising from or related to these Terms shall not exceed the amount of fees paid by you to us in the six (6) months preceding the claim, or one hundred U.S. dollars ($100.00), whichever is greater.

## 7. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Deed Shield, its officers, and employees from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your violation of these Terms or your misuse of the Service (including the unauthorized upload of real PII).

## 8. Governing Law and Venue
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the **State of Illinois**, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising under these Terms shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in **Cook County, Illinois**.

## 9. Modifications
We may modify these Terms at any time by posting the revised version. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the changes.
