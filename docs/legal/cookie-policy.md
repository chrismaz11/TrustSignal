# Cookie & Tracking Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-01-16

---

## 1. Scope
This policy applies to the Deed Shield web portal and simulator environment (the "Service"). It explains how we use cookies and similar tracking technologies.

## 2. Our Philosophy: B2B First-Party Only
Deed Shield is a business-to-business (B2B) verification utility.
- **No Third-Party Ad Trackers:** We do not sell your data or allow third-party advertising networks to track you across our Service.
- **No Cross-Site Tracking:** We do not monitor your behavior on other websites.

## 3. Cookies We Use

### 3.1. Essential Cookies (Strictly Necessary)
These are required for the Service to function. You cannot opt out of these.
- **Session ID:** Maintains your login state (`sid`).
- **CSRF Token:** Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks (`csrf_token`).
- **Load Balancer:** Directs traffic to the correct server node.

### 3.2. Performance & Analytics (First-Party)
We use internal analytics to understand system performance and usage patterns.
- **Metric:** Usage volume (verifications per minute).
- **Metric:** Error rates (API 500/400 responses).
- **Storage:** These are stored in our own server logs and aggregated dashboards, not sent to Google Analytics or Meta Pixel.

## 4. Managing Cookies
Most browsers allow you to block cookies. However, blocking **Essential Cookies** will cause the Service (login, upload, verification) to fail.

## 5. Updates
We may update this policy if we introduce new features. Check the "Version" date at the top.
