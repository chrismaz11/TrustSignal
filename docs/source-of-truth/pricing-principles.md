# Pricing Principles

> [!NOTE]
> Synthesized Source of Truth.

## Core Philosophies
1.  **Volume-Based**: Pricing is determined at the time of conversion based on committed monthly verification volume.
2.  **No Public Numbers**: We do not publish standardized rate cards. Every engagement is custom-quoted.
3.  **Pilot Pricing**: Pilots are typically structured with a flat access fee or are subsidized for strategic partners.

## Tiers (Concept Only)
- **Boutique**: Low volume, pay-as-you-go.
- **Mid-Market**: Monthly commit with overage.
- **Enterprise**: Custom SLA, dedicated support, volume discounts.
