# Legal Positions & Disclaimers

> [!NOTE]
> Synthesized Source of Truth.

## Core Legal Doctrine
1.  **Verification, Not Legal Opinion**: Deed Shield provides technical verification signals based on cryptographic and metadata checks. It **DOES NOT** provide legal opinions, title abstracts, or guarantees of validity. A "PASS" result means the data matches the registry, not that the deed is legally sound.
2.  **Master Service Terms (Beta/Pilot)**: Services are provided under "Master Service Terms" with specific "Pilot" or "Beta" disclaimers.
3.  **No Warranty**: The service is provided "AS IS" without warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
4.  **Liability Limitation**: Liability is strictly limited to fees paid in the last 6 months (or $100). Indirect, special, or consequential damages are excluded.
5.  **Governing Law**: State of Illinois.

## Specific Disclaimers
- **Notary Status**: We verify against a specialized registry. We do not guarantee the notary is currently active in the official state database (SOS) in real-time unless explicitly stated.
- **Blockchain Anchoring**: We are not responsible for public blockchain (Polygon) downtime, forks, or consensus failures.
- **Off-Chain Storage**: Encrypted metadata is stored off-chain; we are not custodians of the original document content.
