# Pilot Boundaries

> [!NOTE]
> Synthesized Source of Truth.

## Critical Constraints
1.  **Simulator Only**: The current deployment is a **Verifier Simulator**. It is not connected to live county recording systems.
2.  **Synthetic Data Only**: All pilots must operate on **synthetic, non-PII data**. Real deeds with real people's names must NOT be processed during this phase.
3.  **No Liability**: Pilot participants acknowledge that the system is experimental and provided without warranty.

## Pilot Goals
- Validate the "Receipt" data structure.
- Test the integration with the Notary Registry.
- Prove the stability of the Polygon Amoy anchor.
