# Compliance Alignment

> [!NOTE]
> Synthesized Source of Truth.

## Approach to Compliance
Deed Shield is **designed to align** with industry standards for data integrity and privacy. We do not currently hold third-party certifications (SOC2, ISO 27001).

## Alignment Points
1.  **Data Minimization**: We process hashes, not PII. This aligns with GDPR and CCPA principles of data minimization.
2.  **Audit Trails**: Our immutable receipt and blockchain anchoring strategy aligns with **MISMO** guidelines for verifiable audit trails in e-Mortgage transactions.
3.  **RON Standards**: Our verification logic is designed to support **MISMO Remote Online Notarization (RON)** standards by validating tamper-evidence in PDF bundles.

## What We Do NOT Do
- We do not act as a custodian of record.
- We do not verify the identity of the signer (we verify the *notary's* seal and authority).
